# pcm2discord

A simple server that sends PCM audio data to a Discord voice channel.

Expected audio format is **16-bit signed PCM, 48kHz, stereo.**

## Usage

Create `.env` file:

```sh
DISCORD_TOKEN=
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
docker-compose run --rm worker yarn
```

Run the bot:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Then send your audio to the TCP server at `127.0.0.1:28282`. It is expected that the audio data will arrive in real-time.

There is also an API endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:28280/count` that returns the number of listeners. The `count` is the number of people in the channel, while `listening` is the number of people whose Deafen is off.

Also, when non-bot chat messages are sent to the [voice channelâ€™s text chat](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359-Text-Channels-Text-Chat-In-Voice-Channels#h_01FMJT3SP072ZFJCZWR0EW6CJ1), the latest 100 messages detected since startup can be retrieved from `http://127.0.0.1:28280/chat`. It currently does not provide an endpoint to post to the channel, as that can be done via webhooks instead.
